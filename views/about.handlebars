	<h2>About the Club</h2>

	<p>SFCC was founded in 2012 to fill a gap in the San Francisco cycling community.
		Our goal is to bring cyclists together to ride, race,
		share advice, and talk about sunglasses over a post-ride espresso or beer.</p>

	<p>We value:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Fun</li>
		<li>Competition</li>
		<li>Openness</li>
		<li>Inclusiveness</li>
		<li>Community</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If this sounds good to you, join us on <a href="/rides-calendar">a ride</a> and think about
		<a href="/membership">becoming a member</a>.

	<h3>Internet Presence</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sfcyclingclub">Twitter</a>: where we announce rides and link to interesting things</li>
		<li><a href="http://instagram.com/sfcyclingclub">Instagram</a>: where we post photos from rides and races</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Sister Club</h3>

	<p>We have a sister club relationship with the <a href="http://uqcycle.com/">University of Queensland Cycling Club</a>
		based in Brisbane, Australia. Members of each club can participate in the events of the other, join in on rides
		and races as well as purchase each other's kits.</p>
